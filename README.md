# Amazon-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis  
This project analyzes Amazon product reviews using machine learning techniques to classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. By understanding customer sentiment, businesses can make data-driven decisions and enhance their products.
The methodology involves data cleaning, exploratory **data analysis, N-gram analysis, stemming, TF-IDF encoding, and model-building**. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes ratings and sentence reviews. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to analyze the sentiment of the reviews.
Key findings from exploratory data analysis reveal patterns and trends in the data, such as the **relationship between positive reviews and helpful rate, the temporal variation in positive reviews, and the distribution of review counts. N-gram analysis identifies common words and phrases in different sentiment categories.**
The project utilizes classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, KNN Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, and Na√Øve Bayes to classify sentiment. Cross-validation is employed to identify the best performing model.
